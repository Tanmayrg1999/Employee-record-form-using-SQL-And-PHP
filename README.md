# Employee-record-form-using-SQL-And-PHP
I have created a User interface page in php to read the employee details from the user and inserted it into the database.
## What was the main Objective ?
The main goal was to take the record from user and store the employee details in a database server.
Employee details included employee id,employee first-name,employee last-name,employee city,employee date of birth.

## Steps 
The table is created in phpMyAdmin in a databse named user_data an table named as employee_record. phpMyAdmin is a free software tool written in PHP, intended to handle the administration of MySQL over the Web. phpMyAdmin supports a wide range of operations on MySQL and MariaDB. Frequently used operations (managing databases, tables, columns, relations, indexes, users, permissions, etc) can be performed via the user interface, while you still have the ability to directly execute any SQL statement.
XAMPP is the most popular PHP development environment.
XAMPP is a completely free, easy to install Apache distribution containing MariaDB, PHP, and Perl. The XAMPP open source package has been set up to be incredibly easy to install and to use. It was used to start the apache and mySQL server.Xampp can be easily downloaded and installed from https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html.
